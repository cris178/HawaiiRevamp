# Hawai'i Volcanoes Revamp Mockup

This was a web design project I did for school that challeneged students to create a 
revamped website for an existing national park. As the title suggests, I selected the
Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park.

## Getting Started

The files are set up so that they index.html will work if you have all the files next to each other as they are above. Just download and put them in a folder anywhere and launch the index through any browser of your choosing.

## Running into Issues

As stated before this is just a school project. There are various issues that arise depending on the browser. I know for a fact that the font scales terribly in certain cases.  

## Built With(Project Tools)

You can contribute if you want, the project was just for school. I don't plan on working any further on the project. I got the A and that's all that matters right?
